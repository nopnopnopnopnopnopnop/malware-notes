**What is it?**
- Packer is a tool that compresses the content of the malware
- Is used to make static analysis harder (rip strings)
- Can still be dynamically analysed

## Premade
---
- These ones are known to the public and are easier to unpack, a really good example is **UPX**, but there are others, such as : 
	- The enigma Protector
	- MPRESS
	- ExeStealth
	- Morphine
	- ....

## Detection
---
- It will vary from packer to packer, for example for UPX-packed binary, you can simply use the `upx` cli (pre-installed on flare-vm) - `upx -d <binary>`
- You can also use, for example, `PeID` tool, which will automatically detect, which packer is in use.
