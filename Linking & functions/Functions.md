## FUNCTION NAMING CONVENTIONS
---
- **Ex** - When microsoft updates a function, it still supports the old one. To avoid confusion, the new one getx -ex suffix. If if it's updated once again, it'll get two -ex suffixes. `CreateDirectory; CreateDirectoryEx; CreateDirectoryExEx,...`
- **A** - Supports ASCII strings. `CreateFileA`
- **W** - Supports Wide character strings. `CreateFileW`

## Imported Functions
---
- PE file header includes informations about functions used by the program.
- Imported functions can tell you a lot what is the malware up to.
- MSDN library has great source about winapi functions
- https://malapi.io for functions that are commonly used by malware.

## Exported Functions
---
- This is commonly seen in DLLs, where the exported functions can be used by variety of executable in the system.
- EXE's are not common to export functions, although when found, it can provide valuable information... or not
- Let's take a look at `ServiceMain`. It will be used, if you want to run the executable as a service. Pretty straightforward, right?
- Well, it can have any name. It doesn't even have to have one, which makes it difficult for us to detect it. Malware can mislead us, thus it's not the best idea to rely on exported functions, as they can be **MISLEADING**.
