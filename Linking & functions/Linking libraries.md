### Static linking

- Static is one the most uncommon type of linking.
- A statically library is copied to the executable, making it grow in size.
- Worse for analysing, as it's difficult to differ between the executable's code and the statically linked code.

---
## Runtime linking

- Runtime linking is popular within packed/obfuscated malware.
- It only connects to libraries when function needs it, not at start.

---
## Dynamic linking

- The most used one
- It connects to libraries right at the start of the program.
- PE (Portable Executable) file header stores every information about every library that will be loaded.
- We can use tool called **Dependency Walker** to see dynamically linked libraries.

1) Shows all imported libraries
2) Shows all imported functions
3) Shows all functions that can be imported from the library
4) Additional information - tells us the version of DLLs
5) Shows errors.

#### Some DLLs and their description

**Detecting suspicious DLLs is easy with `pestudio` :**

- it will show you this "x", meaning that this DLL is usually used for malicious purposes and should be investigated.
- it also shows you the description, which is nice :
